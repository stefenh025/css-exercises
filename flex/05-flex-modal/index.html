        <!-- The solution lacks additional divs below and leaves the button as is which are
        an inline-block, allowing it to sit next to each element. We have the content
        class in our solution as display:flex which causes the buttons below to grow.
        The solution lacks the content class css and the header is still applied only
        to the text in the header, allowing the buttons to stay as an block and not
        expanding needlessly. Since we are using content class as a flex display, the 
        buttons need an additional div to keep them from growing. -->
